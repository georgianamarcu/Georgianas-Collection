## :sparkles: What was the challenge?

Summarize our current knowledge of :

- HTML and CSS
- Responsive design
- Javascript Basics
- The DOM

to create a collection of items. 

## :grey_question: What was created?

- A JS variable that stored the data for the cards
- A function to generate the cards, to display, hide and filter them by genre 

## :thinking: What was the result?
